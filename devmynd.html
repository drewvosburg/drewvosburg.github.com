            <h4>Design Assignment for DevMynd</h4>
            <p>Actors Studio is a fictional premiere training school for the performing arts looking to supplement their curriculum by incorporating technology into their training methodology.</p>
            <p>The feedback process laid out in this assignment is meant to carefully guard against harsh criticism while providing specific, constructive, actionable criticism that can help performers take their craft to the next level.</p>

          <p>Giving feedback to performance is a delicate thing.  Students are often forming a work in progress, and judgment can do more harm than good if not communicated properly.  The feedback process laid out in this assignment is meant to carefully guard against harsh criticism while providing specific, constructive, actionable criticism that can help performers take their craft to the next level.</p>

	          <h2>Assumptions</h2>
	          <p>For the purpose of the assignment, I made a number of significant assumptions. The primary assumption I made was that feedback is for the benefit of the students to practice giving feedback, as opposed to giving instructors insight into performance. It could be that instructors would like an objective rating of each student which is an average of ratings by other performers in the cohort, but I would assume this isn't the case.</p>
	          <p>A second important assumption is that feedback is meant to benefit the performer receiving the feedback by giving actions that can help them improve, not by judging their current ability or most recent performance. Seeing a numeric rating of your performance could be emotionally damaging and drive down usage of the platform, so instead the focus is providing positive steps toward a better performance.</p>

      	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
      		<h2>Research and Sources</h2>
					<p>I briefly and casually interviewed two friends who have done professional performing arts to get some initial feedback and insights. As a result, I used Liz Lerman's <a href="https://lizlerman.com/critical-response-process/" target="_blank">Critical Response Process</a> as a basic framework for my feedback flow, and I used <a href="https://www.winthrop.edu" target="_blank">Winthrop University's</a> <a href="https://www.winthrop.edu/uploadedFiles/cvpa/THEATREDANCE/library/pdfs/Assessment_Databank/theatre/THRA422ActingStylesScenePerformanceRubric.pdf" target="_blank">theater and dance rubric</a> as a reference for my feedback rubric.</p>

	          <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
	          <p>For platform, I assumed a responsive web platform, with a focus on mobile in an effort to get feedback from students as quickly as possible. I also structured the system to use curiousity as a carrot. Performers must input feedback in order to view the feedback that has been given to them. This is meant to incentivize giving feedback without offering money or course credits. It should be noted that getting the process started would be critical for a system like this, so a small prize may be necessary for the first student to give feedback for the first several weeks.</p>

        		<h2>Process Outline</h2>
        		<p>Here is an outline of the process I would use to get from start to finish on a project like this if it were run at scale with a client:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Interview instructors and students to find needs and concerns</li>
        			<li>Create detailed personas</li> 
        			<li>Map out user flows</li> 
        			<li>Create low fidelity clickable prototypes</li> 
        			<li>User test prototype with students to get feedback</li> 
        			<li>Revise user flows</li> 
        			<li>Brand survey</li> 
        			<li>Style Guide</li> 
        			<li>High fidelity clickable prorotype</li> 
        			<li>Full branding (if within the scolpe of the project)</li> 
        			<li>Build front end HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li> 
        			<li>Build backend database</li> 
        			<li>Roll out limited trial to a few instructors/cohorts</li> 
        			<li>Revise as needed</li> 
        			<li>Deploy at scale</li>
